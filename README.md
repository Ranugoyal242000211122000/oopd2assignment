# Library Management Application

The Library Management Application is a console-based program written in C++. It serves as a tool for managing library operations, including user registration, item search, item borrowing, and tracking issued items. This application is designed to work with books, journals, and publications and allows users to interact with the library system efficiently.

## Features

- *User Registration:* Users can register as either faculty members or students. The system generates a unique user ID for each registered user.

- *Search Item:* Users can search for items (books, journals, and publications) by providing a keyword. The system displays a list of matching items.

- *Request Item:* Users can request to borrow an available item by providing the book ID and user ID. The system checks the availability of the item and records the issue details, including due dates.

- *Display Issued Items:* Users can view a list of all issued items, including their issue dates, return dates, and user information.

- *Display All Users:* Users can view a list of all registered users, including their user IDs, usernames, and user types.

- *Data Loading:* The application reads data from CSV files for books, publications ranks, and journals during initialization. This data is used for searching and issuing items.
